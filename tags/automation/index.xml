      <description>This is the feedback that I sent to someone who is trying to make it in the open source world. Today is Sunday, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of free time, so here it is:
 Since I know how hard it is to thrive in open source, please allow me to be brutally honest in the feedback. I might use strong words but it&amp;rsquo;s because I try to make you understand how to succeed in your project.</description>

      <description>1 day free event workshop in Stockholm It&amp;rsquo;s a one day event where anybody can attend for free in order to see what&amp;rsquo;s available in the cloud build by Google. Here is what the summary of that day. At 8.00 sharp, the doors open to many people who were already waiting. By waiting I mean playing with their phone, like I&amp;rsquo;m doing right now because I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post. The presentation starts and it is a very well polished, very high level with technical anecdotes.</description>

      <description>The era of the terminal Looking back at the time of the mainframe with dummy terminal clients and their black/green screen, it makes me wonder if things really change that much. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s like in everything, some things change, some don&amp;rsquo;t. Deal with it.
If you spend a decent amount of time in a terminal, you might have realized that there are some tasks that are tedious and error prone such as copy pasting a super long string (ssh public key) or some pods name from a kubernetes cluster.</description>
