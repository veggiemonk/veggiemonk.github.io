      <description>1 day free event workshop in Stockholm It&amp;rsquo;s a one day event where anybody can attend for free in order to see what&amp;rsquo;s available in the cloud build by Google. Here is what the summary of that day. At 8.00 sharp, the doors open to many people who were already waiting. By waiting I mean playing with their phone, like I&amp;rsquo;m doing right now because I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post.</description>

If you spend a decent amount of time in a terminal, you might have realized that there are some tasks that are tedious and error prone such as copy pasting a super long string (ssh public key) or some pods name from a kubernetes cluster.</description>
