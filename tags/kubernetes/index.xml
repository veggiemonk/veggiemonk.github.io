      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out Istio for a while now in order to fully grasp what is a service mesh and how to set it up. I made a presentation for the local CNCF meetup in Stockholm where I live.
  Chaos eng-service-mesh  from Julien Bisconti 
The demo took the most time to prepare and there was a lot of material to cover but it got me going. Hopefully, I can record the presentation and put it online.</description>

      <description>1 day free event workshop in Stockholm It&amp;rsquo;s a one day event where anybody can attend for free in order to see what&amp;rsquo;s available in the cloud build by Google. Here is what the summary of that day. At 8.00 sharp, the doors open to many people who were already waiting. By waiting I mean playing with their phone, like I&amp;rsquo;m doing right now because I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post.</description>

      <description>The era of the terminal Looking back at the time of the mainframe with dummy terminal clients and their black/green screen, it makes me wonder if things really change that much. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s like in everything, some things change, some don&amp;rsquo;t. Deal with it.
If you spend a decent amount of time in a terminal, you might have realized that there are some tasks that are tedious and error prone such as copy pasting a super long string (ssh public key) or some pods name from a kubernetes cluster.</description>
