      <description>The era of the terminal Looking back at the time of the mainframe with dummy terminal clients and their black/green screen, it makes me wonder if things really change that much. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s like in everything, some things change, some don&amp;rsquo;t. Deal with it.

Simple HTTP request It is helpful to know how to get data from a server when building a website or an app.</description>
